        Mathematics is pretty cool. With it, we are able to describe the universe around us;
        this tool also allows us to learn more about the universe.
        But, why? Why is math able to do such a fantastic job at describing the universe?
        The answer is simple, that is what mathematics is designed to do. Math isn’t
        just some arbitrary thing we stumbled across,
        it was created to be useful in explaining aspects of our world. In our very early history,
        math was probably used for trading.
        They needed a mathematical model to describe
        the combining of groups of objects and came up with addition.
        Likewise, early math was strongly based in geometry to make building things
        easier and quantifying land. If the original mathematical models hadn’t worked,
        the mathematicians of the day would have abandoned the faulty model and invented a newer,
        more accurate one (this happens even in today’s science).
